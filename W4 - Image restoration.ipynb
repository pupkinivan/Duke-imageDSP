It is also a good approximation to other types of noise, e.g. when looking at one pixel or group of pixels.\n","1. **Rayleigh**\n","\n","    As opposed to AWGN, it does appear in physical systems.

When we add noise to the image, the resulting PDF is equal to the convolution of the image PDF with the noise PDF.\n","\n","The type of noise and its parameters can actually be estimated from the histogram. First, a region as flat as possible in the image is selected, in order to optimally get a pure peak and the noise surrounding it. The region needs to be big enough to get a histogram that is not too noisy. Then, by computing the mean and variance of that region, we can obtain the different parameters of the different types of noise, which are usually related to the first two. We can fit the best possible model for each of the different types of noise: the one with the smallest divergence would be the correct one.\n","\n","It is also normal to estimate the type of noise in several regions to check if the noise is the same or in order to get many estimations of the same one, which would yield a better estimate."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zCujnCssVr6B","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Filtering"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"scN7eGnCVtp4","colab_type":"text"},"source":["The different types of noise are more or less effectively filtered by different types of filters.
