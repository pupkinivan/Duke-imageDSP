# Duke-imageDSP
Here are my (Ivan Pupkin) personal notes, some implementations and comparisons of most methods exposed in the [Introduction to image and video processing course][course] by Guillermo Sapiro from Duke on Coursera.

## Notebooks

All notes and algorithms were either implemented or exemplified in Jupyter Notebooks. They are currently:

1. Week 1, **introduction**: no notebook
1. Week 2, image and video **compression**: one notebook with JPEG algorithm theory and another notebook with assignments and practice
1. Week 3, image **enhancement**: notebook with theory and demos on histogram equalization, histogram matching, averaging methods and derivatives in images
1. Week 4, image **restoration**: notebook with techniques for reducing noise and other degradations
1. Week 5, image **segmentation**: notebook with theory on methods for image segmentation
