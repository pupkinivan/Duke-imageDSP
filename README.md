# Duke-imageDSP
Here are my (Ivan Pupkin) personal notes, some implementations and comparisons of most methods exposed in the [Introduction to image and video processing course][course] by Guillermo Sapiro from Duke on Coursera.

## Notebooks

All notes and algorithms were either implemented or exemplified in Jupyter Notebooks. They are currently:

1. Week 1, **introduction**: no notebook
1. Week 2, **image and video compression**: theoretical notebook on JPEG algorithm and a practical notebook with assignments
1. Week 3, **image enhancement**: notebook with theory and demos on histogram equalization and histogram matching
1. TBC
