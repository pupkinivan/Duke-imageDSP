# Duke-imageDSP
Here are my (Ivan Pupkin) personal notes, some implementations and comparisons of the methods exposed in the [Introduction to image and video processing course][course] by Guillermo Sapiro from Duke on Coursera.

## Notebooks

All notes and algorithms were either implemented or exemplified in Jupyter Notebooks. They are:

1. Image compression: JPEG algorithm
1. Image enhancement: histogram equalization, histogram matching
